# Welcome to Zarena bot Docs

## How do I read this docs?

Each category of commands has their own page which can be found on the top navigation bar.  
**Aliases**: \[foo\|bar\] means that you can either use foo or bar.  
**Optional**: \[foo\] means that this argument is optional and can be ignored.  
**Optional with default**: \[foo='muted'\] means that it will default to the value if you don't specify anything else.  
**Required**: &lt;foo&gt; means that you _must_ use this argument for the command to work.

    Do not literally type out &lt; &gt; \[ \] etc

Additionally, the bot uses what are called _converters_ which makes specifying roles, members, channels etc easy and fool-proof. When asked to specify a member, you can provide it a mention (pinging the person), an id, their name or their nickname. This principle works for every single command where applicable.
