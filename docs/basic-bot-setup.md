# Basic bot setup

## 1. Setting up the prefix
The default prefix of zarena is **\$** but you can set your own prefix, to do that you need to run **\$prefix <your prefix\>**.<br>
For ex. **\$prefix !** will set the bot's prefix to **!**

!!! note
    You can use **\$prefix reset** command to reset bot's prefix anytime.

!!! tip "ProTip"
    If you don't know the bot's prefix then ping zarena and she will tell her current prefix :smile:

## 2. Setting up a mute role
Zarena has a dedicated mute command, if mute role isn't already set up in your server then just run the **mute** command, it will set up everything for you, you don't have to do anything manually.

## 3. Setting up join and leave messages
*This is currently disabled since it requires server member intent which zarena doesn't have for now*

## 4. Setting up logs channels
Coming soon...

## 5. Setting up modlogs channel
Coming soon....

## 6. Setting up bypass in a server
You can't use internet commands in non-nsfw channel because serching nsfw content may result nsfw contents. Since Discord doesn't allow you to access nsfw channel if you are below 18 and if you want to search sfw content using internet commands then use can't, so to overcome this you need to enable bypass using **$bypass on** command to bypass this, Again you are only responsible for this.

!!! note
    Bypass can be toggle on and off anytime.

## 7. Setting up anti raid mode in server
Coming soon....
